=======

SharingCommons is an online community for sharing books and movies. Primarily geared toward physical media, SharingCommons allows indexing your own library, exploring your friends' libraries, and checking out from each other's libraries, similar to a traditional library. Never lose track of your precious books and movies again.

##Background
SharingCommings is the continuation of [BookOut](http://github.com/byu-osl/bookout), a project I led in CS 428 at BYU. Originally built to share physical books only, I added support for digital books and both phsyical and digital movies. Because I never took it anywhere, I open sourced this project.

##Demo
